# Personal-AI-Projects

A collection of self-initiated AI projects focused on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), LangChain, and agentic systems. These hands-on explorations reflect my learning journey in LLM development and showcase tools that bridge human language and machine reasoning.

## ðŸ“‚ Projects

- **Ask This Book â€“ Kafka Edition**  
  A LangChain-based RAG system that allows users to interact with *The Metamorphosis* by Kafka. Combines FAISS vector search with `flan-t5-large` for reproducible, offline generation.

(More coming soon...)
